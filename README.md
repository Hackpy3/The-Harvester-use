### **Examples of Using theHarvester**

#### 1. **Basic Domain Search**:
   Search for information about `example.com` using Google and limit the results to 100:
   ```bash
   theHarvester -d example.com -l 100 -b google
   ```

#### 2. **Search Multiple Sources**:
   Query multiple sources (e.g., Google and Bing):
   ```bash
   theHarvester -d example.com -l 100 -b google,bing
   ```

#### 3. **Save Output to a File**:
   Save results to an HTML file for later review:
   ```bash
   theHarvester -d example.com -l 100 -b google -f output.html
   ```

#### 4. **Using Shodan (API Key Required)**:
   If you have a Shodan API key, you can integrate it to gather IP-related information:
   ```bash
   theHarvester -d example.com -l 100 -b shodan
   ```

#### 5. **Full Reconnaissance Example**:
   Collect all possible information about `target.com` using every available source:
   ```bash
   theHarvester -d target.com -l 500 -b all
   ```
